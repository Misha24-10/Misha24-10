# F5-TTS Fine-tuned for Russian

This repository contains a demonstration of the F5-TTS model fine-tuned for Russian language speech synthesis, compared against other leading models (X-TTS and FishSpeech).

## Project Overview

The demo showcases the capabilities of speech synthesis models on Russian language content, with a particular focus on:
- Voice cloning with minimal reference audio
- Preservation of emotional intonation and speaking style
- Poetry recitation with proper rhythm and prosody
- Handling of various text genres and styles

## Model Details

- **F5-TTS (Fine-tuned)**: A Diffusion Transformer model, fine-tuned on 5K hours of Russian and English speech
- **X-TTS**: Transformer-based model with 27,281 hours of training data (147 hours of Russian)
- **FishSpeech**: Dual Autoregressive architecture trained on approximately 1 million hours (20K hours of Russian)

## Model Weights

**Coming Soon!** The weights for the fine-tuned F5-TTS model will be released in the near future. Stay tuned for updates.

## Example Use Cases

- Voice cloning for personalized assistants
- Audiobook generation with emotional delivery
- Poetry and literature narration
- Media content creation

## Limitations and Ethical Considerations

This technology is intended for research purposes only. Users should be aware of:
- The potential for misuse in creating misleading audio content
- The need for consent when cloning real voices
- Legal implications of synthetic voice use
